# 🌱 Spring Framework Learning Journey

This repository documents my complete learning experience with the **Spring Framework**, covering core concepts, hands-on practice, and real-world backend development patterns.  
The goal of this repository is to demonstrate my understanding of Spring fundamentals and how they are applied in scalable Java applications.

## 📌 What This Repository Represents

- A structured journey from **core Spring concepts** to **Spring Boot–based applications**
- Practical implementation of **dependency injection**, **MVC architecture**, and **database integration**
- Clean, modular, and maintainable backend code following **industry best practices**
